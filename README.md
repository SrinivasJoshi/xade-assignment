##  ðŸš€ How to start app


1. Create a `.env` file in the root of application and add your OpenAI Key
	```
	OPEN_AI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key`
	```
2. Run the following command in the terminal : 
	``` 
	npm start
	 ```
3.  Visit browser after the build is complete : http://localhost:8081/

4. OR Scan the QR Code using expo app and test the application. 

PS : Remind me to delete the new OpenAI API key I used to test :)
